                    <h1>PIG DICE GAME INSTRUCTIONS</h1><br>
                    <p>Pig is the perfect way to pass the time with family. And all you need is one six-sided
                        die and a way to keep score.On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to
                        accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the
                        numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any
                        points they have
                        accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from
                        previous turns, just the
                        total earned during that particular roll.

                        A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
                        rolling a 1 and losing
                        all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled
                        during that turn are added
                        to his or her score.

                        When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the
                        winner.</p>
